# Current work queue

Updated: 2026-09-01. Full execution state and test evidence: [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md).
Campaign plan: [`docs/plans/2026-08-30-full-backlog-campaign.md`](../docs/plans/2026-08-30-full-backlog-campaign.md).

The completed implementation is committed locally at `5fb58037`, followed by the handoff
consolidation. Preserve these unpushed commits. Do not reset, push, tag, or publish without
explicit authorization.

## Maintainer/release gates

- [ ] ARC-053: soak the minified release APK; ARC-062/096 implementation is already present.
- [ ] ARC-054: decide whether v1.6 release notes announce ru and synthesis-holdout-only el.
- [ ] ARC-063: narrow blanket R8 keeps only after the first minified soak.
- [ ] Decide any nonzero `finger_occlusion_offset` default only from device-trace A/B evidence.

## Agent-executable backlog

- [ ] ARC-067: translate the common 384 missing resources into all 21 locale files. Preserve
  placeholders and plurals shapes; do not use English copies. ARC-066/087 are complete.
- [x] Finish Wave E: ARC-073 citation/doc drift (`d20ed3b5`), ARC-098 phantom-`keyboard2`
  tooling sweep (`f482faf4`), the four verified doc-claim repairs, and the
  `contraction_pairings_cleaned.json` gate run (the file was already deleted in `030265ee`).
  ARC-076 and ARC-089 are complete. ARC-098's source-tree half (`gesture/`,
  Bridges/Initializers→`wiring/`) remains under ARC-072 slice 3 below.
- [ ] ARC-072 slice 3 composition-root/reorg work, folded with the gesture portion of ARC-098.
- [ ] ARC-027/028/029 geometric experiments, evidence-gated on non-regressing corpus replay.
- [ ] ARC-071 Astro 6 migration and ARC-046 web regression gate/Tailwind vendoring.
- [ ] ML-side ARC-060/061 and the documented verb-inversion feasibility work. (ARC-056
  uk/bg/mk/he lexicons/langpacks CLOSED 2026-09-01 — `538a1633`/`86156ea3`.)
- [ ] ARC-044 remaining assertion-strengthening batch (no Truth dependency in androidTest).

## Verification backlog

- [x] Final guarded host gates on implementation commit `5fb58037`: `runPureTests` 2,087 and
  `runMockTests` 343, both passing on 2026-09-01.
- [ ] Wave J: full ew-cli instrumented run, including ARC-058/064/074/077/091/092/095.
- [ ] Wave K: both authorized phones per the campaign protocol; restore IME/properties and
  never framework-restart Saga. Capture ARC-068/069/070 evidence.
- [ ] Wave L remainder: update the ARC ledger and maintainer-input report. HANDOFF, backlog, and
  campaign-plan state were consolidated on 2026-09-01.

# Current work queue

Updated: 2026-09-27. Full execution state and test evidence: [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md).
Campaign plan: [`docs/plans/2026-08-30-full-backlog-campaign.md`](../docs/plans/2026-08-30-full-backlog-campaign.md).

The September 1 campaign baseline was `5fb58037`; subsequent work through `79f0b464`
was pushed with maintainer authorization on September 27. Preserve shared-tree work.

## September 27 follow-through

- [x] Prior 54 commits through `79f0b464` pushed; commit-specific CI, site deployment,
  APK build and UI/performance workflows succeeded.
- [x] Existing `langpacks` release updated: Norvig asset removed; 22 replacements and
  description published; all 22 downloaded SHA-256 hashes verified.
- [x] Local Astro build: 84 pages pass under Bun using the current `bin/astro.mjs` entry.
  Legacy wiki HTML URLs are deployment-generated redirects, not stale published bodies.
- [x] Site TypeScript check and `build:termux` pass; Android Rollup is optional and the
  lockfile is synchronized. No dependency versions changed.
- [x] Builder now rejects unsupported `--lang` before any reads/writes; mypy passes after
  correcting fractional-count annotations/callback typing. CKLM encoding matches the previous
  implementation across all six corpus-selection weights on a controlled fixture.
- [x] Final local gates: Kotlin compilation, Android lint, 2,610 pure tests and 859 mock
  tests pass (guarded run 7m51s). Site build: 84 pages, 104 affected-page links resolve;
  TypeScript and Python mypy pass. Saga connected read-only; no app/settings changes.
- [x] Translation structural audit: 936/936 resources in all 21 locales; indexed arguments
  and plural items match. Expanded translation guard passes 6/6 focused tests.
- [x] Multilingual LM pilot (2026-09-29): per-language builder configs (en byte-identical),
  language-parameterised S1 eval + drift test. Spanish FAILED S1 (prefix-1 +4.69 < +5), so
  nothing beyond `en` ships; de/fr/it measured passing, pt/sv failing —
  `docs/eval/2026-09-29-static-lm-multilingual.md`.
- [x] Static LM contraction-lookup fix + per-language shipping (2026-09-29): REPLACE keys
  (`dont`, `cest`) now resolve to the display form the model names (was backoff only — en
  `i → dont` 0.51 vs `i → don't` 27.5). One re-evaluation, unchanged gates: de +5.16, fr +6.75,
  it +7.48 pt prefix-1 → SHIPPED (with Tatoeba contributor lists, NOTICE, PROVENANCE);
  es/pt/sv still fail, unshipped. `docs/eval/2026-09-29-static-lm-multilingual.md`.
- [x] Next-word allow check admits contraction display forms through their apostrophe-free
  dictionary key (`NextWordContractionAllowTest`, 2026-09-29).
- [ ] TODO: es/pt/sv LM retry needs a changed input selected on dev; the legacy hardcoded tables
  still hurt `static_only` tap ranking for languages without an LM (outside the LM files).
- [x] Pack-attribution UI: Settings → Multi-Language → Language Packs → Manage shows each pack's
  licence, credit, source links and full NOTICE.txt (`269d8bb1`/`6fed1b12`, 2026-09-29).
- [x] `privacy_forget_learned_body` names swipe corrections in all 22 locales (`535a2a28`);
  terminology unified per locale with `TranslationGlossaryTest` (`4871c7e5`, `a91aad5a`).
- [ ] TODO: native-speaker translation review and device visual verification remain distinct
  from automated structural checks; preserve the maintainer's manual-checklist edits.

## Maintainer/release gates

- [ ] ARC-053: soak the minified release APK; ARC-062/096 implementation is already present.
- [ ] ARC-054: decide whether v1.6 release notes announce ru and synthesis-holdout-only el.
- [ ] ARC-063: narrow blanket R8 keeps only after the first minified soak.
- [ ] Decide any nonzero `finger_occlusion_offset` default only from device-trace A/B evidence.

## Agent-executable backlog

- [ ] ARC-067: translate the common 384 missing resources into all 21 locale files. Preserve
  placeholders and plurals shapes; do not use English copies. ARC-066/087 are complete.
- [x] Finish Wave E: ARC-073 citation/doc drift (`d20ed3b5`), ARC-098 phantom-`keyboard2`
  tooling sweep (`f482faf4`), the four verified doc-claim repairs, and the
  `contraction_pairings_cleaned.json` gate run (the file was already deleted in `030265ee`).
  ARC-076 and ARC-089 are complete. ARC-098's source-tree half (`gesture/`,
  Bridges/Initializers→`wiring/`) remains under ARC-072 slice 3 below.
- [ ] ARC-072 slice 3 composition-root/reorg work, folded with the gesture portion of ARC-098.
- [ ] ARC-027/028/029 geometric experiments, evidence-gated on non-regressing corpus replay.
- [ ] ARC-071 migration is superseded by the installed Astro 7 site; reconcile the remaining
  ARC-046 web regression gate/Tailwind vendoring evidence.
- [ ] ML-side ARC-060/061 and the documented verb-inversion feasibility work. (ARC-056
  uk/bg/mk/he lexicons/langpacks CLOSED 2026-09-01 — `538a1633`/`86156ea3`.)
- [ ] ARC-044 remaining assertion-strengthening batch (no Truth dependency in androidTest).

## Verification backlog

- [x] Final guarded host gates on implementation commit `5fb58037`: `runPureTests` 2,087 and
  `runMockTests` 343, both passing on 2026-09-01.
- [ ] Wave J: full ew-cli instrumented run, including ARC-058/064/074/077/091/092/095.
- [ ] Wave K: both authorized phones per the campaign protocol; restore IME/properties and
  never framework-restart Saga. Capture ARC-068/069/070 evidence.
- [ ] Wave L remainder: update the ARC ledger and maintainer-input report. HANDOFF, backlog, and
  campaign-plan state were consolidated on 2026-09-01.
